# DSA_Python
The repository contains my notes and related materials of DSA.

Note that notes_py.md is mainly about the syntax while DSA_py.md is basically a template for implementing certain data structures and algorithms, and algo_template.md is virtually the same as DSA_py in contents but was written in c++ a year ago, when I was learing the course [算法基础课 by AcWing](https://www.acwing.com/activity/content/11/).
