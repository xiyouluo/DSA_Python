# DSA_python
The repository contains my notes and related materials of DSA.

Note that notes_py.md is mainly about the syntax while DSA_py.md is basically a template for implementing certain data structures and algorithms, and algo_template.md is actually the same as DSA_py in contents but for c++ a year ago.
The three notes files are all written by me.
