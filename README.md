# DSA_Python
This repository contains my summary and related materials on data structures and algorithms. The main notes file is *Data Structure and Algorithm_handout.md*, which focuses on explaining the principles of data structures and algorithms, and organizing the “mindset” behind coding problems for computer-based exams. It represents the results of my own thinking and reference material summaries, and is for reference only.



The *notes_py.md* file contains issues related to Python syntax that I encountered during my studies. 



The *cheat_sheet.md* file contains knowledge points that I was worried I hadn’t fully memorized before exams. Individual differences in this regard are significant, so my cheat sheet may not be applicable to others. Readers can extract content from the main notes to create their own cheat sheets.



Other files serve as auxiliary files for the main notes, providing bidirectional links between files (I use Obsidian for editing to utilize this feature. The double brackets [[ ]] within the notes represent such links, and readers can also use Obsidian for a better reading experience).
